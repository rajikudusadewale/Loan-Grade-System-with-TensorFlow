# Loan-Grade-System-with-TensorFlow
TensorFlow, Keras, Pythion, Deep Learning



This project is a loan grade system implemented using TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to predict the grade of loans based on various features and attributes.

#### Project Overview
The Loan Grade System with TensorFlow is designed to analyze loan data and predict the grade of a loan. The grade of a loan is an important factor in determining the risk associated with it. By accurately predicting the loan grade, lenders can make informed decisions about approving or rejecting loan applications.

#### Key Features
- Data preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the loan data for analysis.
- Feature engineering: Various features are extracted from the loan data to improve the accuracy of the prediction model.
- Model training: The loan grade prediction model is trained using TensorFlow, a popular deep-learning library.
- Model evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance.
- Prediction: The trained model can be used to predict the grade of new loan applications.


#### Dataset
The project uses a loan dataset obtained from LendingClub. The dataset contains various attributes of loans, such as loan amount, interest rate, credit score, employment status, etc. This dataset is used for training and evaluating the loan grade prediction model.


Happy coding!
