# Loan-Grade-System-with-TensorFlow
TensorFlow, Keras, Pythion, Deep Learning


## Overview
This project develops a Loan Grade Prediction system using TensorFlow, aimed at predicting the grade of loans based on various features. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of machine learning algorithms, the system provides insights into loan grading which can be crucial for financial institutions in assessing credit risk.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values and preparing the dataset for model training.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies the most relevant features that impact loan grading.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes TensorFlow to create and train models for predicting loan grades.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project and run the notebook in your local environment.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
1. Install the required libraries using pip. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
